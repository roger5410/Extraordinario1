Logistic regression is one of the most used statistical-inferential techniques in contemporary scientific production. It arises in the 1960s, its generalization depends on the solution to the problem of the evolution of the coefficients. The Walker - Duncan algorithm for obtaining the maximum likelihood estimators partly solved this problem, but it was of such a nature that the use of computers was essential.

The logistic regression model is used when we are interested in forecasting the probability of a certain success occurring or not.

A process is said to be binomial when it only has two possible results: "success" and "failure", the probability of each of them being constant in a series of repetitions.

A binomial process is determined by the probability of success, represented by p, the probability of failure is represented by q, and both times are related by p + q = 1. Sometimes, the quotient p / q, called "probabilities", is used. , and which indicates how much more likely success is than failure, as a characteristic parameter of the binomial distribution.
