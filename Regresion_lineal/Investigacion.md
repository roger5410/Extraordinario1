Linear regression

The dependent variable is something that you want to predict or explain. The independent variable is what is used to explain or predict the dependent variable.

Dependent variable = Constant + Slope * Independent variable + Error:

The constant term in the equation above is the point of intersection with the Y axis; By convention, Y is used to represent the dependent variable and X the independent variable. The slope is the degree of inclination of a line, it is the quantity Y that changes when X changes by a certain amount.

The term Error is very important for several reasons, one is that we can rarely, if ever, predict exactly from X. And when it happens, it happens to us that Y and X may be the same or that we have an error in our data. The error pattern also gives us a measure of how reliable our model is and how we can improve it.

When we have more than one independent variable, we will call the method multiple regression, this method is the most used currently since with a single variable we will only see a reflected part of the problem.

The basic idea is very simple: draw a line through an XY scatter diagram in such a way that our errors are minimized.

The relationship between the response variable and the predictor variables can be identified through the following equation, with which we are already familiar, since it is the equation of a line:

y = β0 + β1 x + ε

where

β0 = the intersection coefficient, (cut with the y-axis)
β1 = slope, regression coefficient of the independent variable
x = the independent variable
ε = error of error term

β0 and β1 are the regression coefficients and denote the slope of the line and the cut with the Y axis.
