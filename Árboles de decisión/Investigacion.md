## Decision tree

A decision tree is a flowchart-like structure in which each internal node represents a "test" on an attribute (for example, if a coin heads or tails), each branch represents the test result, and each leaf node represents a class label (decision made after calculating all attributes).

In simpler terms, a decision tree checks whether an attribute or set of attributes meets a condition and is based on the result of the check, the following checks are performed. The tree divides the data into different parts based on these controls.
